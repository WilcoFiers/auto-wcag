title: Auto-WCAG Rule Template
---

The test template contains a plain language description of the test, some background information, and a list of all assumptions. The test properties are summarized in a table. The actual test is defined by the selector, a number of steps and a formal description of the test outcomes.

The format of the test properties and outcomes is aligned with EARL.
Use the [empty test template](rule-template-empty.md) to create new auto-wcag tests on this wiki.

For the name of the test case use the following format: **SC#-#-#-identifier**

- **SC#-#-#**: This is an identifier for the criterion to which the test case applies. #-#-# stands for the number of that criterion, such as SC4-1-2.

- **+SC#-#-#**: This can be used if the test case applies to multiple success criteria, such as SC1-1-1+SC4-1-2-identifier. The numbers are in the same order as they are used in WCAG.

- **identifier**: This must be a lower case identifier of the test, preferable no more then 3 words. It can only contain alphanumeric values or a dash (-).

## Background

- Links to Techniques for WCAG 2.0
- Latest version: Techniques for WCAG 2.0 W3C Working Group Note 8 April 2014
- Link to other methodologies, test specifications or tools
- Links to test cases, test suites, unit tests, etc.
- The WCAG 2.0 Techniques already contain examples and code snippets to illustrate which content passes or fails the test. Whenever possible auto-wcag refers to those. Another source for test cases is the W3C Before and After Demonstration.

## Test properties

| Properties        | Values
|-------------------|-----------
| Test name         | User friendly test name
| Success criterion | x.x.x name
| Test mode         | automated / semiautomated / manual

## Test procedure

### Selector

Test method: [automatic][AUTO]

How to get the right elements

### Step 1

Test method: [automatic][AUTO]

Check if at least one of the elements referenced by the valid `aria-describedby` attribute values exists.

if yes, continue with [step 2](#step-2)

else, return

| Outcome  | Failed
|----------|-----
| ID       | {{ page.rule_id }}-fail1
| Error    | None of the elements referenced by aria-describedby exists.

### Step 2

Test method: [manual][MANUAL]

[MANUAL]: ../pages/test-modes.html#manual
