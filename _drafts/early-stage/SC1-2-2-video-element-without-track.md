Back to Success Criterion [[1.2.1_Audio-only_and_Video-only_(Prerecorded)]]

## Description
This test checks that for prerecorded video-only content an alternative text or audio version exists, which is relevant and descriptive for the video-only content.
## Background
- [http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140916/G159 G159: Providing an alternative for time-based media for video-only content]
- [http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140916/G166 G166: Providing audio that describes the important video content and describing it as such]
- [http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140916/F30 F30: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 due to using text alternatives that are not alternatives (e.g., filenames or placeholder text)]
- [http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140916/F67 F67: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 due to providing long descriptions for non-text content that does not serve the same purpose or does not present the same information]
## Assumptions
- The video is not a media alternative for another media
- The test does not check for programmatic determinability of the media alternative or a reference such as "The description can be found in text below" from the short text alternative of the video to it.
